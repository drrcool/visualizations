"""Small module to load a colormap that's similar to tableau.

The main package (tableau20) takes no inputs and simply returns a nice
colormap that (at least from reading many blogs) is visually appealing to
a large number of people (and from personal experience is much better than
matplotlib defaults).

Colormap was adopted from a blog post on randalolson.com:
